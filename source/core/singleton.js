/** section: core
 * class JS.Singleton
 * 
 * `Singleton` is a class used to construct custom objects with all the inheritance features
 * of `JS.Class`, the methods from `JS.Kernel`, etc. It constructs an anonymous class from the
 * objects you provide and returns an instance of this class.
 **/
JS.Singleton = new JS.Class({
  /**
   * new JS.Singleton(name, parent, methods)
   * - name (String): the name of the singleton, used for debugging
   * - parent (JS.Class): the parent class to inherit from
   * - methods (Object): list of methods for the singleton
   * 
   * `Singleton`s are instantiated the same way as instances of `JS.Class`, the only difference
   * being that `Singleton` returns an instance of the newly created class, rather than the
   * class itself.
