  h3. @JS.Test@
  
  JS.Class includes a testing framework called @JS.Test@. You can use it to test
  any JavaScript code, not just programs written with JS.Class, and it's
  designed to run on a wide variety of platforms without configuration. In
  combination with "@JS.Packages@":/packages.html it makes it really easy to
  organise and run your test suite in a way that works cross-platform. It runs
  without modification on all of JS.Class's "supported platforms":/platforms.html.
  
  When running in the browser, @JS.Test@ will automatically notify "TestSwarm":http://www.testswarm.com/
  if you're using it, so you can easily use @JS.Test@ for your continuous
  integration setup.
