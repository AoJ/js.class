  @JS.Class@ is a library designed to facilitate object-oriented development in JavaScript. It
  uses several idioms borrowed from Ruby to simulate classes, inheritance, mixins and modules.
  
  h3. Download version 1.6
  
  1.6 adds the "@Forwardable@":/forwardable.html and "@State@":/state.html modules, and makes some small changes to the modules
  API. All @Module@ objects now have both @included@ and @extended@ methods, and a new @extended@
  hook has been implemented to allow objects to run code when they are added to classes using
  @extend()@. 1.6 Also introduces "@JS.Ruby@":/ruby.html, a DSL for more Ruby-like class definition syntax.

  More in-depth topics can be found in the sidebar. This is a simple introduction to class creation.
  All @JS.Class@ classes are defined as follows:
  
  <pre>
  var Animal = new JS.Class({
    initialize: function(name) {
      this.name = name;
    },
    speak: function(things) {
      return 'My name is ' + this.name + ' and I like ' + things;
    }
  });</pre>
  
  All classes should have an @initialize()@ method. That method will get called to instantiate
  the class' objects. It receives any arguments you use when creating an instance, for example:
  
  <pre>
  var pig = new Animal('Porky');
  pig.speak('mud')   // -> "My name is Porky and I like mud"</pre>
  
  Any other methods in your class definition become instance methods for the class, as the above
  example demonstrates. There are a few exceptions to this rule, as you will find out if you
  read the articles in the sidebar.
