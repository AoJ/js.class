  h2. A JavaScript class library.
  
  @JS.Class@ is a portable JavaScript class library, influenced by the "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org/
  programming language. It provides a rich set of tools for building
  object-oriented JavaScript programs, and is designed to run on a wide variety
  of "client- and server-side platforms":/platforms.html.
  
  h3. Features
  
  The library provides many of Ruby's powerful features, including:
  
  * Ruby-like object system with classes, mixins, and singleton methods
  * Late-binding arguments-optional @super@ calls to parent classes and mixins
  * @included@, @extended@ and @inherited@ hooks
  * Method binding
  * Reflection APIs for the object system
  * Conventions for object equality, comparison, iteration and hashing
  * Versions of various standard Ruby modules and data structures
  
  It also provides a cross-platform "package manager":/packages.html and a
  powerful "testing framework":/testing.html, so it's easy to make sure your own
  code works across a range of platforms.
