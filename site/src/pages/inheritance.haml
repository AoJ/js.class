  h3. Inheritance and @super@
  
  It is worth pointing out that, strictly speaking, JavaScript (pre version 2) has no such thing
  as classes. It has functions, and if you put the word @new@ in front of a function call it
  creates a new object using that function. It uses prototypal inheritance, in which objects
  inherit from other objects rather than classes from classes. @JS.Class@ attempts to gloss over
  all that and to make JavaScript more like a classical language.
  
  To create a subclass of, say, @Animal@, you pass it in as the first argument when creating a new
  class. Recall our @Animal@ class:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  var Animal = new JS.Class({
    initialize: function(name) {
      this.name = name;
    },
    speak: function(things) {
      return 'My name is ' + this.name + ' and I like ' + things;
    }
  });</pre>
  
  We can create a class @Dog@ as follows:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  var Dog = new JS.Class(Animal, {
    speak: function(stuff) {
      return this.callSuper().toUpperCase() + '!';
    },
    huntForBones: function(garden) {
      // ...
    }
  });</pre>
  
  @Dog@ does not need its own @initialize()@ method as it inherits one from @Animal@. However, it
  chooses to override the @speak()@ method with its own version.
  
  Now we come to a special method generated by @JS.Class@, called @callSuper()@. This method gets
  created dynamically inside method calls and allows you to access the current method in the parent
  class. Like in Ruby, you don't have to pass any arguments to @callSuper()@, thus avoiding repetition.
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  var rex = new Dog('Rex');
  rex.speak('barking')
      // -> "MY NAME IS REX AND I LIKE BARKING!"</pre>
  
  @callSuper()@ is not accessible from outside the object:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  rex.callSuper();
      // -> rex.callSuper is not a function</pre>
  
  You can pass arguments to @callSuper()@ to override the ones passed in automatically, e.g.:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint">
  var Dog = new JS.Class(Animal, {
    speak: function(stuff) {
      stuff = stuff.replace(/[aeiou]/ig, '_');
      return this.callSuper(stuff).toUpperCase() + '!';
    }
  });
  
  var rex = new Dog('rex');
  rex.speak('something')
      // -> "MY NAME IS REX AND I LIKE S_M_TH_NG!"</pre>
